# Ledger Live - Cursor Rules

## Design System - LDLS (Lumen)

@node_modules/@ledgerhq/ldls-ui-react/ai-rules/RULES.md

## Project Structure

This is a pnpm monorepo containing:
- `/apps/ledger-live-desktop` - Electron desktop application
- `/apps/ledger-live-mobile` - React Native mobile app
- `/libs/` - Shared libraries and packages

## Code Standards

### TypeScript
- Always use TypeScript for new code
- Prefer explicit types over `any`
- Use proper typing for Redux actions and state

### React
- Use functional components with hooks
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Keep components small and focused

### Imports
- Use workspace: protocol for internal packages
- Use catalog: for shared dependencies (see pnpm-workspace.yaml)
- Import paths: Use `~` alias for renderer code, `LLD` alias for newArch code

### Styling
- Desktop: Use Tailwind CSS with LDLS design tokens
- Follow LDLS rules for colors, spacing, and typography
- Avoid inline styles unless necessary

## Testing
- Write tests for business logic
- Use `@testing-library` for component tests
- Run `pnpm test` before committing
