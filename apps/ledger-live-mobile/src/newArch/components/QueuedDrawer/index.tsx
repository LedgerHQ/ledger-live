/**
 * A drawer taking into account the currently displayed drawer and other drawers waiting to be displayed.
 *
 * This is made possible thanks to a queue of drawers waiting to be displayed. Once the currently displayed drawer
 * is not displayed anymore (hidden), the next drawer in the queue is notified, and it updates its state
 * to be make itself visible.
 *
 * Setting to true the isRequestingToBeOpened prop will add the drawer to the queue. Setting to false will remove it from the queue.
 *
 * A new drawer can bypass the queue and forcefully close the currently displayed drawer by setting the isForcingToBeOpened prop
 * to true. This entirely cleans the drawers queue. It notifies the removed drawers by calling their onClose prop.
 *
 * The queue is cleaned when its associated screen loses its navigation focus. If a drawer is requesting to be opened while
 * its associated screen has not the focus, it is not added to the queue and its onClose prop is called.
 *
 * You can also block the drawer for closing by setting the modalLock redux app state.
 * To do this, you can use the component components/ModalLock.
 * A drawer can still forcefully close other drawers and opens itself while the modalLock is set to true.
 *
 * Note: avoid conditionally render this component. Always render it and use isRequestingToBeOpened to control its visibility.
 * Note: to avoid a UI glitch on Android, do not put this drawer inside NavigationScrollView (and probably any other ScrollView)
 *
 * @param isRequestingToBeOpened: to use in place of isOpen. Setting to true will add the drawer to the queue.
 *   Setting to false will remove it from the queue. Default to false.
 * @param isForcingToBeOpened: when set to true, forcefully cleans the existing drawers queue, closes the currently displayed drawer,
 *   and displays itself. It should only be used when the drawer has priority over the other drawers in the queue.
 *   Prefer using isRequestingToBeOpened insted to respect the queue order. Default to false.
 * @param onClose: when the user closes the drawer (by clicking on the backdrop or the close button) + when the drawer is hidden
 *   (this is currently due to a legacy behavior of the BaseModal component. It might change in the future).
 *   Even if you set noCloseButton, the drawer can be closed for other reasons (lost screen focus, other drawer forced it to close).
 *   It is a good practice to always clean the state that tried to open the drawer when onClose is called.
 * @param onModalHide: when the drawer is fully hidden
 * @param noCloseButton: whether to display the close button or not
 * @param preventBackdropClick: whether to prevent the user from closing the drawer by clicking somewhere on the screen
 *   or on the back button
 * @params all other props are passed to the BaseModal component. Double check the behavior of the props you pass
 *   before using them in production. Do not use the isOpen prop.
