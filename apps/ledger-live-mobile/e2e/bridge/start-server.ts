This script will allow you to upload app.json userdata files into LLM

Steps:
1. Run the react native app in one terminal: pnpm mobile start
2. Get the name (excluding the .json file extension) of the app.json file you want in the e2e/setups folder. Run the following command in another terminal: pnpm mobile e2e:loadConfig <EXAMPLE FILE NAME>
3. Run the mobile app in mock mode by adding MOCK=1 to the .env file and then running: pnpm mobile ios
4. Every time you reload the app or make a code change in LLM and save it, the app.json data will refresh
