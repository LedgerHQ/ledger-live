> Ledger Live is a new generation wallet desktop application providing a unique interface to maintain multiple cryptocurrencies for your Ledger Nano S / Blue. Manage your device, create accounts, receive and send cryptoassets, [...and many more](https://www.ledger.com/ledger-launches-ledger-live-the-all-in-one-companion-app-to-your-ledger-device).

## Architecture

Ledger Live is an hybrid desktop application built with Electron, React, Redux, RxJS,.. and highly optimized with [ledger-core](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/lib-ledger-core) C++ library to deal with blockchains (sync, broadcast,..) via [ledger-core-node-bindings](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/lib-ledger-core-node-bindings). It communicates to Ledger hardware wallet devices (Nano X / Nano S / Blue) to verify address and sign transactions with [ledgerjs](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/tree/develop/libs/ledgerjs). Some logic is shared with [live-common](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/tree/develop/libs/ledger-live-common).

## Download

The latest stable release is available on [ledger.com/ledger-live](https://www.ledger.com/ledger-live/).

Previous versions and pre-releases can be downloaded on here from the [Releases](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/releases) section.

### Compatibility

- macOS 10.14+
- Windows 8.1+ (x64)
- Linux (x64)

## Signed hashes

Ledger Live releases are signed. The automatic update mechanism makes use of the signature to verify that each subsequent update is authentic. Instructions for verifying the hash and signatures of the installation packages are available [on this page](https://ledger-live-tools.now.sh/lld-signatures), which will be integrated into the [official download page](https://www.ledger.com/ledger-live/download).

# Development

## Setup

### Requirements

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) `lts/gallium` (v16.x)
- [PnPm](https://pnpm.io) (v7.x)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/) (v3.5+)
- A C/C++ toolchain (see [node-gyp documentation](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp#on-unix))
- On Linux: `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install libudev-dev libusb-1.0-0-dev`

## Install

> Reminder: all commands should be run at the root of the monorepository

```bash
# install dependencies
pnpm i
```

## Run

```bash
# launch the app in dev mode
pnpm dev:lld
```

## Build

```bash
# Build & package the whole app
# Creates a .dmg for Mac, .exe installer for Windows, or .AppImage for Linux
# Output files will be created in dist/ folder

# build all the required dependencies
pnpm build:lld:deps
# then use alias to trigger the `dist` script in ledger-live-desktop project
pnpm desktop build

# or you can use the top level script (pnpm build:lld:deps not required in this case)
pnpm build:lld
```

## Debug

If you are using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) IDE, here is a [Launch Configuration](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/nodejs/nodejs-debugging#_launch-configuration) that should allow you to run and debug the main process as well as the render process of the application.

As stated in the [debugging documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging), this file should be named `launch.json` and located under the `.vscode` folder at the root of the monorepository.

```json
{
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "compounds": [
    {
      "name": "Run and Debug LLD",
      "configurations": ["Debug Main Process", "Debug Renderer Process"],
      "stopAll": true
    }
  ],
  "configurations": [
    {
      "name": "Debug Main Process",
      "type": "node",
      "request": "launch",
      "cwd": "${workspaceFolder}",
      "runtimeExecutable": "pnpm",
      "args": ["dev:lld"],
      "outputCapture": "std",
      "resolveSourceMapLocations": null,
      "env": {
        "ELECTRON_ARGS": "--remote-debugging-port=8315"
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "Debug Renderer Process",
      "type": "chrome",
      "request": "attach",
      "address": "localhost",
      "port": 8315,
      "timeout": 60000
    }
  ]
}
```

## Config (optional helpers)

### Environment variables

(you can use a .env or export environment variables)

```bash
NO_DEBUG_COMMANDS=1
NO_DEBUG_DB=1
NO_DEBUG_ACTION=1
NO_DEBUG_TAB_KEY=1
NO_DEBUG_NETWORK=1
NO_DEBUG_ANALYTICS=1
NO_DEBUG_WS=1

other envs can be seen in [live-common:src/env.ts](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/blob/develop/libs/ledger-live-common/src/env.ts)

### Run tests

> Reminder: all commands should be run at the root of the monorepository

```bash
pnpm desktop test
```

### Run code quality checks

```bash
pnpm desktop test:codecheck
```

## Localization / Translations

Translations from English to other languages are handled internally so it is not possible to directly contribute to them, however if you spot a bug (e.g. a wrong variable name) or any issue in translation files, feel free to report a bug to Ledger's support team and it will be taken care of.
