# @shared/i18n

## 0.2.0-next.0

### Minor Changes

- [#21265](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/pull/21265) [`5b78670`](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/commit/5b78670b9587b4ebfe47d0743da1be94b6d85193) Thanks [@gre-ledger](https://github.com/gre-ledger)! - Add `@shared/i18n`, a thin i18n context bridge so `features/*` and `domain/*` components can call `useTranslation()` and render `<Trans>` instead of receiving translated strings as props.

  Both apps now build their i18next engine with an explicit `createInstance()` rather than the global singleton, and mount `<I18nProvider>` at their root alongside the existing `<I18nextProvider>`. Non-React call sites import the app instance (`~/renderer/i18n/init` on Desktop, `~/i18n/instance` on Mobile) instead of `i18next`, enforced by a lint rule.

  `@features/flow-pay-feature-tour` is the pilot: it resolves its own `payTab.featureTour.*` copy and no longer takes any copy props.
