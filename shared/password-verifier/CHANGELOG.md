# @shared/password-verifier

## 0.3.0-next.0

### Minor Changes

- [#21074](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/pull/21074) [`a8c34d0`](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/commit/a8c34d0d9469b4e11339edfbef53445e58194fd8) Thanks [@Sebastien-Dav1d](https://github.com/Sebastien-Dav1d)! - Introduce `@support/jest-shared` with `createSharedJestConfig` and `createSharedUiJestConfig` factories; wire all `shared/*` jest configs to use them.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- [#20847](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/pull/20847) [`197acad`](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/commit/197acad8c74b6fe833ce8dbf78db472643b00819) Thanks [@LucasWerey](https://github.com/LucasWerey)! - Add the two app lock packages the User App Authentication tickets build on: `@shared/password-verifier` (the verifier record and its constant-time comparison) and `@features/platform-app-lock` (protection state schemas, biometrics status unions and errors).

  No functional change to Ledger Wallet Mobile: `react-native-keychain` now resolves through the pnpm catalog instead of a direct pin, so the app and `@features/platform-app-lock` cannot drift apart. It still resolves to 10.0.0.
