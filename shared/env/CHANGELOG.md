### Minor Changes

- [#20593](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/pull/20593) [`d5ea888`](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/commit/d5ea888d3a154feeb29b452841749d358629b8c1) Thanks [@liviuciulinaru](https://github.com/liviuciulinaru)! - Start the Baanx login with a PKCE challenge and a CSRF state (LIVE-34738)

  Pressing Login now mints a login attempt client-side — a 16-byte `state` and a 32-byte PKCE verifier,
  with `code_challenge = BASE64URL(SHA256(verifier))` — and sends it to
  `GET /v1/auth/oauth/authorize/initiate`, whose `url` answer is opened in the platform
  secure browser as before. The randomness comes from the platform CSPRNG on each side: `expo-crypto`
  on mobile, WebCrypto on desktop.

  The redirect URI now reaches the secure browser too, since that is what ends the session:
  `ASWebAuthenticationSession` matches the callback against it, and so does the Android polyfill. The
  opener only opens the URL; the redirect goes back to the app, so the browser result is not read and
  closing the browser shows no error — a cancelled login is not a failed one.

  The initiation carries `mode=api`. Without it the endpoint answers `302` and redirects to the hosted
  UI, which a `fetch` follows into an HTML page; `api` returns the same URL as JSON instead. That answer
  also carries the JWT of Baanx's programmatic flow, which the hosted UI does not need, so the schema
  drops it instead of parking a short-lived credential in the cache.

  The request goes through `useInitiateAuthorizeMutation` from `@domain/api-card-management`, which owns
  the Card Auth contract and injects it into the shared `cardApi` service. Every endpoint there is
  declarative — `query`, `rawResponseSchema`, `transformResponse`, `responseSchema` — so the wire shape
  is validated at the boundary and mapped in one place. `cardApiExtra` keeps only what the base query
  needs: the base URL, the Baanx client key for the `x-client-key` header, and the session accessors.

  The OAuth client id and redirect URI are the app's, so they reach `CardLogin` as an `oauthConfig`
  prop: one value goes to the initiation and to the secure browser, and the token exchange will send it
  again. Baanx uses the same value for the client key and the OAuth `client_id`, and the provider matches
  `ledgerlive://paytab` verbatim on the token exchange. Each platform container opens the returned URL
  itself, and no host-provided opener is needed. The Baanx secret key stays server-side and is never
  sent from the apps.

  The challenge is spent on the initiation, and nothing keeps the attempt afterwards. Completing the
  callback — holding the `state` and the verifier, verifying the `state`, exchanging the code for
  tokens and storing them in `expo-secure-store` — is the remainder of LIVE-34738 and is not part of
  this change.

- [#20816](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/pull/20816) [`cad4f63`](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/commit/cad4f63be4a3b16880ab490195af1f17921e03c2) Thanks [@liviuciulinaru](https://github.com/liviuciulinaru)! - Show the signed-in card holder, and let them log out

  `CardLogout` is a new component, and it is the only one that knows about logging out. It shows the
  account id and the verification state, which is everything the user schema holds, beside a logout
  action. Logout tells the provider first, while the session can still authorize that call, then clears
  the session, the login attempt and the Card cache. A logout on a dead network still logs the user out
  on this device.

  The two directions stay apart. `CardLogin` runs the login and shows nothing once somebody is signed
  in; `CardLogout` shows nothing until somebody is. Each one decides that for itself, so the Pay tab
  places both and passes `CardLogout` nothing.

  They agree through one Redux flag, `payCardAuth.isSignedIn`, because two login machines would each
  hydrate the session and neither would agree with the other. The machine writes the flag on entering
  `ready`, `idle` and `error`. `CardLogout` writes it once a logout is through, and the machine takes a
  `SESSION_ENDED` event to put the login back on offer.

  `CARD_OAUTH_REDIRECT_URI` now defaults to `https://go.ledger.com/ledger/card-baanx`. The provider
  whitelists an HTTPS address, and it must match on the token exchange too.

  `oauthConfig` gains `deepLink`, which is what closes the secure browser.
  `ASWebAuthenticationSession` takes the scheme of this value as its `callbackURLScheme`, and the
  Android polyfill matches the incoming link against the whole of it.

  One value cannot serve both jobs. The provider accepts an `https` redirect URI alone, and only a
  custom scheme ends a browser session. With no value that matches, the login still completes through
  the app's own deep link, but nothing closes the browser and it stays on top of the Pay tab.

  Mobile takes the value from `PAY_TAB_DEEP_LINK`, a new constant that sits beside the linking config
  and shares the path that config maps onto the Pay tab, so the two cannot drift. It is not an
  environment variable: the scheme is declared in `AndroidManifest.xml` and `Info.plist`, so it cannot
  change without a release. Desktop passes no `deepLink`, because the user's own browser opens the page
  and reports nothing back (LIVE-34740).

  - `coin-sui` gains a third transport on `sui.rpc.v2` over gRPC-web, covering every capability from
    checkpoints to device signing.
  - New tri-state `suiTransport` feature flag (`json` | `grpc` | `graphql`), defaulting to `json`,
    replaces the boolean `suiGraphqlTransport`, which is removed. An unrecognised value resolves to
    `json`.
  - New env vars `API_SUI_GRPC_PROXY` and `API_SUI_TESTNET_GRPC_PROXY`. `@mysten/sui` 2.9.0 → 2.23.1.
  - Operation `blockHash` carries the real checkpoint digest on gRPC.
  - Fix: account sync read a single page of history on GraphQL and gRPC, capping an account at its
    newest 50 operations for good — sync resumes from the newest stored operation and never re-reads
    what it skipped. Both arms now walk up to `TRANSACTIONS_LIMIT` (300), the depth JSON-RPC reached.
  - Fix: a resumed sync on GraphQL and gRPC read backwards from the tip, so when more than
    `TRANSACTIONS_LIMIT` transactions arrived between two syncs, the ones in the middle were skipped
    and the next sync resumed above them — a permanent hole. Both arms now walk forward from the
    cursor, as the JSON-RPC arm already did, leaving anything unread newer than the next resume point.
  - Fix: an account holding no operations resumed from its stored `syncHash`, so a cleared cache came
    back with only the transactions that arrived after it. Such an account now re-reads its history,
    which is also how one truncated by the bug above recovers. Token operations count as history: they
    live in the subaccounts, so a token-only account is no longer treated as empty.
  - Fix: on gRPC, any failure to resolve a cursor's digest — including a transient network error — was
    read as "unknown digest", which falls back to an unbounded page from the tip and made paging report
    the end of history. Only a `NOT_FOUND` does that now; everything else propagates and is retried.
  - Fix: reading history skipped transactions that shared a checkpoint with the resume point, in
    account sync (`getOperations`) as well as paging (`getListOperations`).
  - Fix: paging inferred "more to come" from how many operations survived client-side filtering, which
    ended the walk early. GraphQL now reads `pageInfo`, gRPC the stream's `QueryEnd` reason. A page
    whose transactions were all filtered out now resumes from the page's own boundary instead of
    reporting the end of history.
  - Fix: a gRPC history record with no timestamp became an operation dated 1970 that could not serve as
    a pagination cursor. Those records are now dropped, as the GraphQL arm already did.
  - Fix: ascending paging on GraphQL returned the newest slice of the range instead of walking forward
    from the oldest.
  - Fix: the Sui fetcher dropped `X-Ledger-Client-Version` and all gRPC-web headers when passed a
    `Headers` instance.
  - Fix: GraphQL resolved the latest checkpoint in two queries, so the second could answer null. It is
    now one query.
  - A checkpoint missing its `digest` or `timestamp` now raises on both GraphQL and gRPC, instead of
    reporting a block with an empty hash and a 1970 timestamp.
  - Known limitation: `getListOperations` resumes from a synthesised `timestamp:digest` cursor, so
    within one checkpoint a sibling whose digest sorts earlier can be skipped, and a checkpoint holding
    more than one page is stepped over rather than resumed inside. Account sync is unaffected: it
    resumes from the server's own watermark cursor.

Ledger Live consumers (live-common, desktop, mobile and coin-celo) are updated to resolve and pass config/context explicitly. Also fixes a coin-polkadot type-inference issue where `getTransactionMaterialWithMetadata`'s cache-key extractor narrowed the cached signature and dropped the `config` argument.

  When gas estimation failed, its `BigNumber(0)` fallback travelled back to the sign step, where it was read as a deliberate custom gas limit. That disabled re-estimation and produced a transaction the node rejected with `intrinsic gas too low`. A non-positive gas limit is no longer honoured as a custom value, so the estimation runs again, and crafting now fails rather than sending a zero gas limit to the device (LIVE-32644).

  `EIP1559_BASE_FEE_MULTIPLIER` goes from 1.27 to 1.6, so an estimated transaction stays includable for 4 blocks instead of 2 (the base fee grows by at most 12.5% per block). Max fees displayed on chains using the Ledger gas tracker will be higher, but the amount actually paid is unchanged: EIP-1559 charges the base fee plus the priority fee, and the max fee is only a ceiling (LIVE-32650).

Ledger Live consumers (live-common, desktop, mobile and coin-celo) are updated to resolve and pass config/context explicitly. Also fixes a coin-polkadot type-inference issue where `getTransactionMaterialWithMetadata`'s cache-key extractor narrowed the cached signature and dropped the `config` argument.

- [#20715](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/pull/20715) [`3c36af2`](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/commit/3c36af2185860d32bfaad670df7c49a3458e44c3) Thanks [@YazhuEth](https://github.com/YazhuEth)! - Fix EVM transactions being signed with a zero gas limit, and widen the EIP-1559 max fee headroom.

  When gas estimation failed, its `BigNumber(0)` fallback travelled back to the sign step, where it was read as a deliberate custom gas limit. That disabled re-estimation and produced a transaction the node rejected with `intrinsic gas too low`. A non-positive gas limit is no longer honoured as a custom value, so the estimation runs again, and crafting now fails rather than sending a zero gas limit to the device (LIVE-32644).

  `EIP1559_BASE_FEE_MULTIPLIER` goes from 1.27 to 1.6, so an estimated transaction stays includable for 4 blocks instead of 2 (the base fee grows by at most 12.5% per block). Max fees displayed on chains using the Ledger gas tracker will be higher, but the amount actually paid is unchanged: EIP-1559 charges the base fee plus the priority fee, and the max fee is only a ceiling (LIVE-32650).
