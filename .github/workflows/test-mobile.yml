          If you run this manually, and want to run on a PR, the correct ref should be refs/pull/{PR_NUMBER}/merge to
          have the "normal" scenario involving checking out a merge commit between your branch and the base branch.
          If you want to run only on a branch or specific commit, you can use either the sha or the branch name instead (prefer the first verion for PRs).
