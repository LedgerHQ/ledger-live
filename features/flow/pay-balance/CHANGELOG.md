# @features/flow-pay-balance

## 0.4.0-next.0

### Minor Changes

- [#21347](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/pull/21347) [`b3a86f5`](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/commit/b3a86f5ae5ab80d6f09fa4e5f6738e3eacc696c8) Thanks [@mcayuelas-ledger](https://github.com/mcayuelas-ledger)! - Move Pay balance/action-tile copy resolution into @features/flow-pay-balance via @shared/i18n so hosts no longer pass translated labels.

- [#21014](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/pull/21014) [`e1c2a4b`](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/commit/e1c2a4bf3cabe5f58f8b3f8f226dfc90a0ab0296) Thanks [@mcayuelas-ledger](https://github.com/mcayuelas-ledger)! - Fix Pay tab bottom sheets so the filter opens expanded and deposit options stay fully visible

- [#21175](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/pull/21175) [`911a996`](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/commit/911a996f2a6d999d194cadd4f842235cddbe1361) Thanks [@tonykhaov](https://github.com/tonykhaov)! - Show Pay action tiles in every hero state (LIVE-36422).

- [#21144](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/pull/21144) [`62008f0`](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/commit/62008f0bcb6b2bcb3a866111c774a66d0f048961) Thanks [@tonykhaov](https://github.com/tonykhaov)! - Keep Pay hero empty vs funded from cached holdings; skeleton the amount only when funded (LIVE-36422).

- [#21131](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/pull/21131) [`09af9b1`](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/commit/09af9b1b9f7c39db4c6d0cbd1a038fd43784240b) Thanks [@mcayuelas-ledger](https://github.com/mcayuelas-ledger)! - Rename the Pay flow packages to drop the redundant `card` segment: `@features/flow-pay-card-balance` → `@features/flow-pay-balance`, `@features/flow-pay-card-deposit` → `@features/flow-pay-deposit`, and `@features/flow-pay-card-feature-tour` → `@features/flow-pay-feature-tour`. Package paths, npm names and all imports are updated; persisted Redux state keys and component test IDs are unchanged.

- [#21258](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/pull/21258) [`ad1c0ff`](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/commit/ad1c0ff93b94ba9a0b1e7409e5ddbdc2d73bcd30) Thanks [@mcayuelas-ledger](https://github.com/mcayuelas-ledger)! - Add the contacts section to the Pay tab, with a leading Pay tile opening the send flow. Balance, Contacts and Card now share a s24 gap and inherit their horizontal padding from the Pay tab container.

- [#21154](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/pull/21154) [`cf9a982`](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/commit/cf9a9820f9b1ae7405e9bdf3f4947d0f99bb68dd) Thanks [@mcayuelas-ledger](https://github.com/mcayuelas-ledger)! - Wrap the Pay action tiles onto a second line when the hero column is too narrow, instead of shrinking the buttons and breaking their labels over two lines

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- [#20655](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/pull/20655) [`ec8baad`](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/commit/ec8baadf5077e3891c488cf669615a52ad4873b1) Thanks [@mcayuelas-ledger](https://github.com/mcayuelas-ledger)! - Add the desktop Pay hero for the aggregated stablecoin balance. Introduces the `@features/flow-pay-card-balance` package with props-only empty and funded states, wired into the desktop Pay tab and tracking `Page Pay` with the active `balance_filter` (LIVE-34896).

- [#20713](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/pull/20713) [`a3164d8`](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/commit/a3164d88ed131879b072e0b05668a3e881c61850) Thanks [@mcayuelas-ledger](https://github.com/mcayuelas-ledger)! - Add the mobile Pay hero for the aggregated stablecoin balance. The `@features/flow-pay-card-balance` package gains props-only native empty and funded states, and both apps now share the portfolio aggregation through `aggregatePayCardBalance` (LIVE-34898). The hero is mounted at the top of the mobile Pay tab, which tracks `Page Pay` with the active `balance_filter` on view.

- [#20760](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/pull/20760) [`9accbb8`](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/commit/9accbb86a0495f8b7b69f0b923ab9f7a133f661d) Thanks [@mcayuelas-ledger](https://github.com/mcayuelas-ledger)! - Add ActionTiles component with MVVM view-model to the pay-card-balance feature

- [#20735](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/pull/20735) [`c3b8717`](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/commit/c3b87177729f809722127debb8556419f56094c1) Thanks [@mcayuelas-ledger](https://github.com/mcayuelas-ledger)! - Add a stablecoin balance filter picker to the Pay card hero.

- [#20784](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/pull/20784) [`19e578a`](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/commit/19e578a92209e96cabe400661757689e73b43005) Thanks [@mcayuelas-ledger](https://github.com/mcayuelas-ledger)! - Move the Pay Card UI Redux state out of the removed `@domain/entity-pay-card` package into the owning feature flows: the balance filter goes to `@features/flow-pay-card-balance` and the feature-tour seen flag to `@features/flow-pay-card-feature-tour`. The apps keep persisting it under the existing `payCard` key (no data migration). Both flows expose a UI-free `./state` entry so store, persistence and test setup can use the slice without pulling in the flow UI.

- [#20806](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/pull/20806) [`eb4d29e`](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/commit/eb4d29ee1a9879963621168b1e208c53e532d28f) Thanks [@mcayuelas-ledger](https://github.com/mcayuelas-ledger)! - Drop the redundant `PayCard` prefix from the public API of `@features/flow-pay-card-balance`. The package path already scopes the feature, matching sibling flows (`FeatureTour`, `CardLogin`). The hero is now exported as `Balance`, with `useBalanceData`, `aggregateBalance`, `buildBalanceData` and `Balance*` types.

- [#20830](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/pull/20830) [`42fca4a`](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/commit/42fca4a650043e297b2bcbdd098c6743126d7247) Thanks [@mcayuelas-ledger](https://github.com/mcayuelas-ledger)! - Use the Bundle symbol instead of Placeholder for the balance filter option fallback icon (web and native).

- [#20642](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/pull/20642) [`a61f702`](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/commit/a61f702a6e41f2bf84d5602930e261a708507efa) Thanks [@mcayuelas-ledger](https://github.com/mcayuelas-ledger)! - Persist the pay card hero balance filter across app restarts

- [#20755](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/pull/20755) [`e291645`](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/commit/e291645e8acb488323bf2ef8a26f045e6415c3fd) Thanks [@mcayuelas-ledger](https://github.com/mcayuelas-ledger)! - Add the mobile stable balance filter (native select under the hero + queued bottom-sheet picker) and share the filter option and stablecoin logic between desktop and mobile

- [#20788](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/pull/20788) [`7c20f72`](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/commit/7c20f72fb4e7cc0c3e728961d5e9823faef6dcb4) Thanks [@mcayuelas-ledger](https://github.com/mcayuelas-ledger)! - Add the Pay action tiles to the LWD Card screen: mount the shared ActionTiles view-model under the balance hero (Add stablecoin / Request / New payment), add per-tile `appearance` support to the ActionTiles component, and extract the PayTab action-tiles and balance labels into dedicated hooks.

- [#20800](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/pull/20800) [`c8adec3`](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/commit/c8adec33638877b418723ca8473d469afb5be6d2) Thanks [@mcayuelas-ledger](https://github.com/mcayuelas-ledger)! - Add Deposit and Request action tiles to the mobile Pay screen hero
