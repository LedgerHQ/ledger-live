### Minor Changes

- [#21014](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/pull/21014) [`e1c2a4b`](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/commit/e1c2a4bf3cabe5f58f8b3f8f226dfc90a0ab0296) Thanks [@mcayuelas-ledger](https://github.com/mcayuelas-ledger)! - Fix Pay tab bottom sheets so the filter opens expanded and deposit options stay fully visible

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- [#20655](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/pull/20655) [`ec8baad`](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/commit/ec8baadf5077e3891c488cf669615a52ad4873b1) Thanks [@mcayuelas-ledger](https://github.com/mcayuelas-ledger)! - Add the desktop Pay hero for the aggregated stablecoin balance. Introduces the `@features/flow-pay-card-balance` package with props-only empty and funded states, wired into the desktop Pay tab and tracking `Page Pay` with the active `balance_filter` (LIVE-34896).

- [#20713](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/pull/20713) [`a3164d8`](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/commit/a3164d88ed131879b072e0b05668a3e881c61850) Thanks [@mcayuelas-ledger](https://github.com/mcayuelas-ledger)! - Add the mobile Pay hero for the aggregated stablecoin balance. The `@features/flow-pay-card-balance` package gains props-only native empty and funded states, and both apps now share the portfolio aggregation through `aggregatePayCardBalance` (LIVE-34898). The hero is mounted at the top of the mobile Pay tab, which tracks `Page Pay` with the active `balance_filter` on view.

- [#20760](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/pull/20760) [`9accbb8`](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/commit/9accbb86a0495f8b7b69f0b923ab9f7a133f661d) Thanks [@mcayuelas-ledger](https://github.com/mcayuelas-ledger)! - Add ActionTiles component with MVVM view-model to the pay-card-balance feature

- [#20735](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/pull/20735) [`c3b8717`](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/commit/c3b87177729f809722127debb8556419f56094c1) Thanks [@mcayuelas-ledger](https://github.com/mcayuelas-ledger)! - Add a stablecoin balance filter picker to the Pay card hero.

- [#20784](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/pull/20784) [`19e578a`](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/commit/19e578a92209e96cabe400661757689e73b43005) Thanks [@mcayuelas-ledger](https://github.com/mcayuelas-ledger)! - Move the Pay Card UI Redux state out of the removed `@domain/entity-pay-card` package into the owning feature flows: the balance filter goes to `@features/flow-pay-card-balance` and the feature-tour seen flag to `@features/flow-pay-card-feature-tour`. The apps keep persisting it under the existing `payCard` key (no data migration). Both flows expose a UI-free `./state` entry so store, persistence and test setup can use the slice without pulling in the flow UI.

- [#20806](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/pull/20806) [`eb4d29e`](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/commit/eb4d29ee1a9879963621168b1e208c53e532d28f) Thanks [@mcayuelas-ledger](https://github.com/mcayuelas-ledger)! - Drop the redundant `PayCard` prefix from the public API of `@features/flow-pay-card-balance`. The package path already scopes the feature, matching sibling flows (`FeatureTour`, `CardLogin`). The hero is now exported as `Balance`, with `useBalanceData`, `aggregateBalance`, `buildBalanceData` and `Balance*` types.

- [#20830](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/pull/20830) [`42fca4a`](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/commit/42fca4a650043e297b2bcbdd098c6743126d7247) Thanks [@mcayuelas-ledger](https://github.com/mcayuelas-ledger)! - Use the Bundle symbol instead of Placeholder for the balance filter option fallback icon (web and native).

- [#20642](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/pull/20642) [`a61f702`](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/commit/a61f702a6e41f2bf84d5602930e261a708507efa) Thanks [@mcayuelas-ledger](https://github.com/mcayuelas-ledger)! - Persist the pay card hero balance filter across app restarts

- [#20755](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/pull/20755) [`e291645`](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/commit/e291645e8acb488323bf2ef8a26f045e6415c3fd) Thanks [@mcayuelas-ledger](https://github.com/mcayuelas-ledger)! - Add the mobile stable balance filter (native select under the hero + queued bottom-sheet picker) and share the filter option and stablecoin logic between desktop and mobile

- [#20788](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/pull/20788) [`7c20f72`](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/commit/7c20f72fb4e7cc0c3e728961d5e9823faef6dcb4) Thanks [@mcayuelas-ledger](https://github.com/mcayuelas-ledger)! - Add the Pay action tiles to the LWD Card screen: mount the shared ActionTiles view-model under the balance hero (Add stablecoin / Request / New payment), add per-tile `appearance` support to the ActionTiles component, and extract the PayTab action-tiles and balance labels into dedicated hooks.

- [#20800](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/pull/20800) [`c8adec3`](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/commit/c8adec33638877b418723ca8473d469afb5be6d2) Thanks [@mcayuelas-ledger](https://github.com/mcayuelas-ledger)! - Add Deposit and Request action tiles to the mobile Pay screen hero
