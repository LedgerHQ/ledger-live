## 0.6.0-next.0

### Minor Changes

- [#22511](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/pull/22511) [`c32cde3`](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/commit/c32cde31461523c72df4f67cd18288c6f65c9951) Thanks [@mcayuelas-ledger](https://github.com/mcayuelas-ledger)! - Fix drag-and-drop reordering in the card's manage-assets sheet, which never got the gesture

  - `QueuedBottomSheet` takes `enableContentPanningGesture`, so content that owns a drag gesture can stop the sheet's own pan from claiming it.
  - The manage-assets scene turns that gesture off and its list is no longer scrollable, leaving the drag uncontested and letting the sheet size to its rows.
  - The row being dragged takes a `surfacePressed` background.
  - The balance filter sheet sizes to its options instead of always opening at full height, with the confirm button pinned in the sheet's own footer slot.

- [#22577](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/pull/22577) [`b6a9b53`](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/commit/b6a9b531267360fdca64b8db22dd8781aa414dd9) Thanks [@mcayuelas-ledger](https://github.com/mcayuelas-ledger)! - Fix Pay analytics events that never reached Segment, and align the feature-intro page names.

  Pay tracking no longer travels through a React context: `@features/platform-pay-analytics` exposes
  module-level trackers built on `@shared/analytics`, and every Pay flow imports the one it needs.
  The provider could not be reached from inside `@gorhom/bottom-sheet` portals on mobile, so the card
  details sheet and the reward-currencies CTA silently dropped their events. The `onTrackEvent` prop
  is gone from every Pay flow package and from both host apps.

  Card milestone events are now planned from a first-read baseline, so they no longer replay on each
  login. Feature-intro pages report as `Page Feature Intro <flow>`, and the bank transfer flow is
  named `Cash to stable` instead of `C2S`.

- [#22402](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/pull/22402) [`dccea32`](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/commit/dccea322ed808abfa4e6829364fe945cd0a58383) Thanks [@mcayuelas-ledger](https://github.com/mcayuelas-ledger)! - Polish the Pay tab: keep the last row of every Pay bottom sheet clear of the Android navigation bar and the iOS home indicator, size the card action buttons to `md`, make the desktop contacts table responsive with a wider name column, wrap the address-picker title, add 32px of scroll padding, widen the history tabs, fix the disclaimer copy and use the shield icon on verify address

- [#22478](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/pull/22478) [`006991d`](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/commit/006991d2a5c7ea7431cb66d13a972c4aafd90258) Thanks [@tonykhaov](https://github.com/tonykhaov)! - Align the Pay tab with the Home screen: its background fades out on scroll, and the balance and action tiles use the same hero spacing as Home. The Home, Pay, Swap and Earn tabs now share one Reanimated-based background.

The package path already scopes the feature, matching sibling flows (`FeatureTour`, `CardLogin`). The hero is now exported as `Balance`, with `useBalanceData`, `aggregateBalance`, `buildBalanceData` and `Balance*` types.

## 0.2.0-next.0

### Minor Changes

- [#20655](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/pull/20655) [`ec8baad`](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/commit/ec8baadf5077e3891c488cf669615a52ad4873b1) Thanks [@mcayuelas-ledger](https://github.com/mcayuelas-ledger)! - Add the desktop Pay hero for the aggregated stablecoin balance. Introduces the `@features/flow-pay-card-balance` package with props-only empty and funded states, wired into the desktop Pay tab and tracking `Page Pay` with the active `balance_filter` (LIVE-34896).

- [#20713](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/pull/20713) [`a3164d8`](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/commit/a3164d88ed131879b072e0b05668a3e881c61850) Thanks [@mcayuelas-ledger](https://github.com/mcayuelas-ledger)! - Add the mobile Pay hero for the aggregated stablecoin balance. The `@features/flow-pay-card-balance` package gains props-only native empty and funded states, and both apps now share the portfolio aggregation through `aggregatePayCardBalance` (LIVE-34898). The hero is mounted at the top of the mobile Pay tab, which tracks `Page Pay` with the active `balance_filter` on view.

- [#20760](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/pull/20760) [`9accbb8`](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/commit/9accbb86a0495f8b7b69f0b923ab9f7a133f661d) Thanks [@mcayuelas-ledger](https://github.com/mcayuelas-ledger)! - Add ActionTiles component with MVVM view-model to the pay-card-balance feature

- [#20735](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/pull/20735) [`c3b8717`](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/commit/c3b87177729f809722127debb8556419f56094c1) Thanks [@mcayuelas-ledger](https://github.com/mcayuelas-ledger)! - Add a stablecoin balance filter picker to the Pay card hero.

- [#20784](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/pull/20784) [`19e578a`](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/commit/19e578a92209e96cabe400661757689e73b43005) Thanks [@mcayuelas-ledger](https://github.com/mcayuelas-ledger)! - Move the Pay Card UI Redux state out of the removed `@domain/entity-pay-card` package into the owning feature flows: the balance filter goes to `@features/flow-pay-card-balance` and the feature-tour seen flag to `@features/flow-pay-card-feature-tour`. The apps keep persisting it under the existing `payCard` key (no data migration). Both flows expose a UI-free `./state` entry so store, persistence and test setup can use the slice without pulling in the flow UI.

- [#20806](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/pull/20806) [`eb4d29e`](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/commit/eb4d29ee1a9879963621168b1e208c53e532d28f) Thanks [@mcayuelas-ledger](https://github.com/mcayuelas-ledger)! - Drop the redundant `PayCard` prefix from the public API of `@features/flow-pay-card-balance`. The package path already scopes the feature, matching sibling flows (`FeatureTour`, `CardLogin`). The hero is now exported as `Balance`, with `useBalanceData`, `aggregateBalance`, `buildBalanceData` and `Balance*` types.

- [#20830](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/pull/20830) [`42fca4a`](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/commit/42fca4a650043e297b2bcbdd098c6743126d7247) Thanks [@mcayuelas-ledger](https://github.com/mcayuelas-ledger)! - Use the Bundle symbol instead of Placeholder for the balance filter option fallback icon (web and native).

- [#20642](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/pull/20642) [`a61f702`](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/commit/a61f702a6e41f2bf84d5602930e261a708507efa) Thanks [@mcayuelas-ledger](https://github.com/mcayuelas-ledger)! - Persist the pay card hero balance filter across app restarts

- [#20755](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/pull/20755) [`e291645`](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/commit/e291645e8acb488323bf2ef8a26f045e6415c3fd) Thanks [@mcayuelas-ledger](https://github.com/mcayuelas-ledger)! - Add the mobile stable balance filter (native select under the hero + queued bottom-sheet picker) and share the filter option and stablecoin logic between desktop and mobile

- [#20788](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/pull/20788) [`7c20f72`](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/commit/7c20f72fb4e7cc0c3e728961d5e9823faef6dcb4) Thanks [@mcayuelas-ledger](https://github.com/mcayuelas-ledger)! - Add the Pay action tiles to the LWD Card screen: mount the shared ActionTiles view-model under the balance hero (Add stablecoin / Request / New payment), add per-tile `appearance` support to the ActionTiles component, and extract the PayTab action-tiles and balance labels into dedicated hooks.
