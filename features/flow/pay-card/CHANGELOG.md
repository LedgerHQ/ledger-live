### Minor Changes

- [#21244](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/pull/21244) [`f4986f8`](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/commit/f4986f882385e07dbd531d99a0571c67ca91ada0) Thanks [@mcayuelas-ledger](https://github.com/mcayuelas-ledger)! - Show a host-provided Crypto card title on the Pay Card web and native views

- [#21363](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/pull/21363) [`ce47443`](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/commit/ce47443e97f559210443547a7948ef61c01f7feb) Thanks [@liviuciulinaru](https://github.com/liviuciulinaru)! - Read CARD_API_URL and CARD_BAANX_CLIENT_KEY on every use, and not one time at boot. The debug settings can now change the Card tenant without a restart. The mobile app also applies its `.env` values before the store reads them.

- [#21099](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/pull/21099) [`c8614bf`](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/commit/c8614bfbfd1dc8de12731c2c333b9d137f0f2f93) Thanks [@mcayuelas-ledger](https://github.com/mcayuelas-ledger)! - Add `@features/flow-pay-card`, a Contacts-style orchestrator that aggregates the Pay Card leaf flows behind a single `Card` entry point. It follows the app MVVM split — a `Card` container wires a shared `useCardViewModel` to the platform `CardView` — and composes the card face from `@features/flow-pay-card-details` (`CardVisual` with the balance overlay, or the bare `CardArtwork`) with the authentication controls (`CardLogin` / `CardLogout` from `@features/flow-pay-card-auth`), each of which still decides on its own whether it belongs on screen.

  The flow owns the (currently mocked) card balance and assembles the overlay itself, so hosts no longer pass a pre-built visual: they hand over only what they alone know — `formatCountervalue` (needs the app's locale and counter-value currency) and `balanceLabel` (i18n). Both apps now mount `Card` instead of wiring `CardLogin` / `CardLogout` directly: desktop in the Pay tab's right panel, mobile in the Pay tab body. The package composes rather than re-exports: apps that need a single leaf or its Redux state (`@features/flow-pay-card-auth/state`) keep importing that leaf directly.
