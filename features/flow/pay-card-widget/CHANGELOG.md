## 0.5.0-next.0

### Minor Changes

- [#22666](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/pull/22666) [`bc28500`](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/commit/bc2850004d7cbc59aac8093b3739bfcc351daf43) Thanks [@mcayuelas-ledger](https://github.com/mcayuelas-ledger)! - Open card details when the Pay card face is tapped, and replace Top up with Choose card type while that onboarding step is current

- [#22321](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/pull/22321) [`83fac3e`](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/commit/83fac3e00782840d1f118180dfb9afb9a484952c) Thanks [@philipptpunkt](https://github.com/philipptpunkt)! - Read the Pay Card transaction history one page at a time.

  - `getCardTransactions` is an infinite query; `useGetCardTransactionsQuery` becomes `useGetCardTransactionsInfiniteQuery`.
  - `page` moves off the filters onto the query's page param, so `PayCardTransactionsRequest` is filters only.
  - The provider answers a page past the end with an empty array, so an empty page ends the reading. No page size is documented, so a short page is read past at the cost of one further request.
  - A failure over pages already read no longer blanks the list — a later page or a failed refresh alike. Such a failure is not announced anywhere yet.
  - `useCardTransactionsViewModel` exposes `loadMore` and `isLoadingMore`; no surface calls them yet.
  - The joined list is ordered by `dateTime`, newest first, with repeats dropped, because a charge landing between two reads shifts the paging. The ordering applies to callers that only ever read one page.
  - `toPayGlobalProperties` takes `hasCardTransactions: boolean` in place of the transaction list, so analytics reads the first page through `hasCardTransactions` rather than joining the cached history on every `track()`.
  - `loadMore` is not offered once a read has failed, so a scroll-driven caller cannot turn one failure into a request loop.
  - The MSW mock pages, and its page size drops from the 10 #22236 sliced at to 6 — 10 exceeded the eight-charge fixture, so that mock never paged.

- [#22577](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/pull/22577) [`b6a9b53`](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/commit/b6a9b531267360fdca64b8db22dd8781aa414dd9) Thanks [@mcayuelas-ledger](https://github.com/mcayuelas-ledger)! - Fix Pay analytics events that never reached Segment, and align the feature-intro page names.

  Pay tracking no longer travels through a React context: `@features/platform-pay-analytics` exposes
  module-level trackers built on `@shared/analytics`, and every Pay flow imports the one it needs.
  The provider could not be reached from inside `@gorhom/bottom-sheet` portals on mobile, so the card
  details sheet and the reward-currencies CTA silently dropped their events. The `onTrackEvent` prop
  is gone from every Pay flow package and from both host apps.

  Card milestone events are now planned from a first-read baseline, so they no longer replay on each
  login. Feature-intro pages report as `Page Feature Intro <flow>`, and the bank transfer flow is
  named `Cash to stable` instead of `C2S`.

- [#22442](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/pull/22442) [`70d0b90`](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/commit/70d0b90b67ff013f19318378c78a3f3d442f773b) Thanks [@tonykhaov](https://github.com/tonykhaov)! - fix(pay-card): keep lifecycle tracking waiting on onboarding refetches

  `useCardOnboardingStatus` now reports `isFetching` next to `isLoading`, which covers the first
  read only. The lifecycle tracking and the Pay Card devtool read it, so a milestone is no longer
  derived from onboarding signals that a refetch is about to replace.

- [#22424](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/pull/22424) [`3fdebf4`](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/commit/3fdebf4a84f5630192e50aef9a0a60b0c56f6a2f) Thanks [@mcayuelas-ledger](https://github.com/mcayuelas-ledger)! - Refetch card wallet status when returning from Apple or Google Pay so the add-to-wallet CTA can hide.

- [#22402](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/pull/22402) [`dccea32`](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/commit/dccea322ed808abfa4e6829364fe945cd0a58383) Thanks [@mcayuelas-ledger](https://github.com/mcayuelas-ledger)! - Polish the Pay tab: keep the last row of every Pay bottom sheet clear of the Android navigation bar and the iOS home indicator, size the card action buttons to `md`, make the desktop contacts table responsive with a wider name column, wrap the address-picker title, add 32px of scroll padding, widen the history tabs, fix the disclaimer copy and use the shield icon on verify address

- [#22562](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/pull/22562) [`b8a4056`](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/commit/b8a405658b70b0ca43ec94bff53c5d13e2c16487) Thanks [@philipptpunkt](https://github.com/philipptpunkt)! - Keep re-reading the Pay Card status after the holder returns from Apple or Google Wallet, and when the app comes back to the foreground

- [#22382](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/pull/22382) [`c119e0d`](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/commit/c119e0d38f626314cf679bfa06420ce0e4bca03b) Thanks [@mcayuelas-ledger](https://github.com/mcayuelas-ledger)! - Redirect the "choose card type" onboarding step to the Baanx hosted order-card page, and align pay bottom sheet spacing and tile styles

### Minor Changes

- [#22077](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/pull/22077) [`72367fc`](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/commit/72367fcf2343fa488008236f1005da589e6e3054) Thanks [@mcayuelas-ledger](https://github.com/mcayuelas-ledger)! - Wire the card onboarding widget to real, derived onboarding data and remove the unused stub endpoint and legacy devtool mock path it replaces

- [#22192](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/pull/22192) [`c22ee67`](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/commit/c22ee67d3e0271b382337fe4175170bdabf5dfca) Thanks [@mcayuelas-ledger](https://github.com/mcayuelas-ledger)! - Add reusable Apple/Google Pay add-to-wallet CTA, instructions, and wallet-app opening.

- [#22193](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/pull/22193) [`3d50917`](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/commit/3d50917da2e7c2177f8288bb754d41a7699f27be) Thanks [@mcayuelas-ledger](https://github.com/mcayuelas-ledger)! - Open Apple/Google Pay add-to-wallet from card onboarding and the Pay Tab CTA.

- [#22216](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/pull/22216) [`cfa249c`](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/commit/cfa249c4c3a30f9eba1ecee1749030121da9291a) Thanks [@mcayuelas-ledger](https://github.com/mcayuelas-ledger)! - Open Apple Wallet payment-card setup through PassKit.

- [#22218](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/pull/22218) [`285b50d`](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/commit/285b50dc311eef60089f779cffdfe14a0422d2ec) Thanks [@mcayuelas-ledger](https://github.com/mcayuelas-ledger)! - Open Google Wallet through its launch intent, and show iOS and Android error scenes when the wallet app is unavailable, with a Play Store fallback on Android.

- [#22183](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/pull/22183) [`d9d1111`](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/commit/d9d1111733e757cc58b6249fdda568dd56d40757) Thanks [@liviuciulinaru](https://github.com/liviuciulinaru)! - Open the provider's top up page from the card on desktop.

  - `CardTopUpButton` carries the action. On desktop it stays at the bottom of the card panel, above the scrolling content.
  - Desktop opens `/topup` on the hosted live app manifest, the way the signup page already opens.
  - A US card holder gets the US `app_id` on the query, so the page reaches the US tenant.
  - Desktop ends the provider session in the webview on each entry of the Pay tab, so a session left behind by a top up cannot sign the previous holder back in. The login and the signup drop their own wipe: every one of them starts from an entry of the Pay tab.
  - The top up button in the asset details dialog opens the same page, with the asset pre-selected on the query.

- [#22121](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/pull/22121) [`287f042`](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/commit/287f04286e4933e31e31952a3ac6485e145e34f2) Thanks [@philipptpunkt](https://github.com/philipptpunkt)! - Answer the phone wallet step from the provider alone.

  - Mobile reads `cardAddedToDigitalWallet` from the card status for the onboarding step.
  - The device answer is gone: `hasAddedCardToWallet`, its two actions and its selector leave the widget state. The Add-to-Wallet CTA now hides on the provider's answer, and the instructions scene re-asks the card status instead of recording a local yes.
  - A tenant that does not send the flag leaves the step undone and keeps offering the CTA.
  - The onboarding mock gained `cardAddedToDigitalWallet`, so the dev tool's wallet toggle drives the mocked endpoint and follows request mocking like every other step.

- [#22301](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/pull/22301) [`6fe6efb`](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/commit/6fe6efb9f2c9211d6002dd17f4369f90390021bf) Thanks [@mcayuelas-ledger](https://github.com/mcayuelas-ledger)! - Consume the shared Pay analytics provider across card flows.

### Minor Changes

- [#21626](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/pull/21626) [`eddc89e`](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/commit/eddc89e7b86a13aeedfc0ae4956c2dcd08494e5f) Thanks [@philipptpunkt](https://github.com/philipptpunkt)! - Show and drive the derived card onboarding status from the Card / Pay devtool.

  - A "Card onboarding" screen: a `Stepper` for the count, every step by the id the app keys it on, and the derived answer printed raw so a step can be traced to the response behind it.
  - Each step a request decides carries a toggle. It sets what that endpoint answers, so the step follows on the next read and holds until it is cleared. The phone wallet step is answered on the device; the purchase step is read-only while nothing answers it.
  - An endpoint answers from the provider until its toggle is used, so one step can be held while the rest stay real, and "Use the real answers" hands them all back.
  - `@domain/api-card-management/mock/card-onboarding-status` holds those answers and the responses that carry them; the mobile MSW handlers read it before falling back to what they answered before.
  - Mocking is started by an env var, so without it the screen says so instead of offering a toggle that would set an answer nothing reads.
  - The hook gains `refresh`, which re-asks all three sources: the screen asks on open and on demand.

- [#21625](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/pull/21625) [`b976cda`](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/commit/b976cda52320ef3f778fc11b4f95d2c5bf54ffe0) Thanks [@philipptpunkt](https://github.com/philipptpunkt)! - Add `useCardOnboardingStatus`, which works out where a cardholder is in onboarding.

  - Five steps: account, card, funded wallet, card in the phone's wallet, first purchase.
  - Answered by `getUser`, `getCardStatus` and the linked-wallet join; the phone wallet step from the device; the purchase step reads `false` until the transactions endpoint lands.
  - Each step is an id and a flag. Copy and icons belong to whatever renders them.
  - Mobile lists all five, desktop the four it can answer.
  - `completedCount` comes with the steps.
  - Optional `skip`, so a signed-out host holds the reads.

### Minor Changes

- [#21626](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/pull/21626) [`eddc89e`](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/commit/eddc89e7b86a13aeedfc0ae4956c2dcd08494e5f) Thanks [@philipptpunkt](https://github.com/philipptpunkt)! - Show and drive the derived card onboarding status from the Card / Pay devtool.

  - A "Card onboarding" screen: a `Stepper` for the count, every step by the id the app keys it on, and the derived answer printed raw so a step can be traced to the response behind it.
  - Each step a request decides carries a toggle. It sets what that endpoint answers, so the step follows on the next read and holds until it is cleared. The phone wallet step is answered on the device; the purchase step is read-only while nothing answers it.
  - An endpoint answers from the provider until its toggle is used, so one step can be held while the rest stay real, and "Use the real answers" hands them all back.
  - `@domain/api-card-management/mock/card-onboarding-status` holds those answers and the responses that carry them; the mobile MSW handlers read it before falling back to what they answered before.
  - Mocking is started by an env var, so without it the screen says so instead of offering a toggle that would set an answer nothing reads.
