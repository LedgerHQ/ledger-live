# @features/flow-pay-deposit

## 0.3.0-next.0

### Minor Changes

- [#21014](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/pull/21014) [`e1c2a4b`](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/commit/e1c2a4bf3cabe5f58f8b3f8f226dfc90a0ab0296) Thanks [@mcayuelas-ledger](https://github.com/mcayuelas-ledger)! - Fix Pay tab bottom sheets so the filter opens expanded and deposit options stay fully visible

- [#21131](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/pull/21131) [`09af9b1`](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/commit/09af9b1b9f7c39db4c6d0cbd1a038fd43784240b) Thanks [@mcayuelas-ledger](https://github.com/mcayuelas-ledger)! - Rename the Pay flow packages to drop the redundant `card` segment: `@features/flow-pay-card-balance` → `@features/flow-pay-balance`, `@features/flow-pay-card-deposit` → `@features/flow-pay-deposit`, and `@features/flow-pay-card-feature-tour` → `@features/flow-pay-feature-tour`. Package paths, npm names and all imports are updated; persisted Redux state keys and component test IDs are unchanged.

- [#21357](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/pull/21357) [`9f0b607`](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/commit/9f0b607a0e177c1f7474c649e3b5dd7b7924c8aa) Thanks [@mcayuelas-ledger](https://github.com/mcayuelas-ledger)! - Resolve Pay deposit-options copy inside `@features/flow-pay-deposit` through `@shared/i18n` instead of receiving translated strings as props. The deposit options view-model now calls `useTranslation()` for its `payTab.deposit.*` keys, so both apps stop building `DepositOptionsLabels` and passing them to `useDepositOptionsAdapter`.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- [#20842](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/pull/20842) [`841f7a0`](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/commit/841f7a0991ee0a8036f2144858b5d27d654910bc) Thanks [@mcayuelas-ledger](https://github.com/mcayuelas-ledger)! - Add the shared Pay Card Deposit options component and view-model to `@features/flow-pay-card-deposit`: a Lumen dialog on desktop and a bottom sheet on mobile listing the four deposit options (bank transfer, swap, receive, buy), emitting host-owned navigation intents via `onSelect` and tracking via the injected `onTrackEvent`.

- [#20844](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/pull/20844) [`5ff320a`](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/commit/5ff320aaa967388af5d1e3f8d869b42739d0a2ed) Thanks [@mcayuelas-ledger](https://github.com/mcayuelas-ledger)! - Wire the desktop Pay tab "Add stablecoin" tile to the shared Deposit options dialog: pressing it opens the dialog and each option routes to its desktop flow (bank transfer, swap, buy) or the receive asset flow filtered to stablecoins.

  Render the deposit options as Lumen `ListItem` rows.

- [#20856](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/pull/20856) [`d0ac51c`](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/commit/d0ac51c757081a7ac6b5d76899097d3be2c1d07f) Thanks [@mcayuelas-ledger](https://github.com/mcayuelas-ledger)! - Wire the Pay tab "Add stablecoin" tile to the shared Deposit options overlay on both platforms: pressing it opens the dialog (desktop) or bottom sheet (mobile), and each option routes to its platform flow (bank transfer, swap, buy) or the receive flow filtered to stablecoins.

  Extract a shared `useDepositOptionsAdapter` hook in `@features/flow-pay-card-deposit` so desktop and mobile no longer duplicate the deposit options open/close state and props shape.

- [#20812](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/pull/20812) [`4faf5cd`](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/commit/4faf5cdcd91e183777a275123bb7d5c3890adbce) Thanks [@mcayuelas-ledger](https://github.com/mcayuelas-ledger)! - Scaffold the @features/flow-pay-card-deposit dual-platform flow package (empty public API) so the Pay tab Deposit options component and view-model can be added in follow-up tickets.
