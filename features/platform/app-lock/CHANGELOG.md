# @features/platform-app-lock

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- [#21026](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/pull/21026) [`4f514c9`](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/commit/4f514c97491277ea63524e299904fe5e5711d897) Thanks [@LucasWerey](https://github.com/LucasWerey)! - Store a scrypt verifier instead of the password itself. Confirming a password now derives a digest and persists `{version, scrypt, salt, digest}` in the keychain, so nothing that can be replayed as a password is kept anywhere.

  The protection state lands with it: two independent flags plus a session lock, keyed off "any protection is enabled" rather than on having a password, which is the coupling that makes biometrics-only impossible today.

  Ordering is the safety argument throughout — the whole verifier is one keychain item, so an interrupted write leaves the previous verifier or none, never a half-written pairing, and the state flips only once the write has landed. Derivations are serialised: two concurrent setups would otherwise interleave and store a verifier whose salt belongs to the other run.

  The password field also gains a length cap. It sits far above anything anyone types, and exists because deriving a digest is deliberately slow.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- [#20847](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/pull/20847) [`197acad`](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/commit/197acad8c74b6fe833ce8dbf78db472643b00819) Thanks [@LucasWerey](https://github.com/LucasWerey)! - Add the two app lock packages the User App Authentication tickets build on: `@shared/password-verifier` (the verifier record and its constant-time comparison) and `@features/platform-app-lock` (protection state schemas, biometrics status unions and errors).

  No functional change to Ledger Wallet Mobile: `react-native-keychain` now resolves through the pnpm catalog instead of a direct pin, so the app and `@features/platform-app-lock` cannot drift apart. It still resolves to 10.0.0.

- [#20988](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/pull/20988) [`5bd3557`](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/commit/5bd3557bf160876d9a0a392f0bbe1841083560cb) Thanks [@LucasWerey](https://github.com/LucasWerey)! - Add the two-step form for setting an app lock password, behind `lwmPasswordRevamp`. The legacy screens stay on the flag-off path untouched.

  `@features/flow-app-lock` gains one shared password field that every password surface will use, the two entry steps as ViewModel and View, and a draft that carries the chosen password from the first step to the second in memory — not through navigation state, which is serialisable and gets persisted. `@features/platform-app-lock` gains the minimum-length rule, which the migration off short passwords will need as well.

  Nothing is stored yet: confirming closes the flow and leaves the Settings switch off until the verifier lands.
