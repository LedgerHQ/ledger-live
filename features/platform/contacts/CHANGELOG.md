# @features/platform-contacts

## 0.5.0-next.0

### Minor Changes

- [#21151](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/pull/21151) [`545e419`](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/commit/545e4191a1b059058a20f30bdd1925b7c78e682c) Thanks [@claudiiafg](https://github.com/claudiiafg)! - Fix the odd Add contact transition on Mobile by focusing the contact name field only once the drawer has finished opening, so the keyboard no longer resizes the dynamically sized drawer mid-animation. Adds an onOpened callback to QueuedBottomSheet and makes ContactNameInput focus reactively rather than only on mount.

- [#21234](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/pull/21234) [`7fae8f5`](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/commit/7fae8f5f7f22aa84933b734266de73cd9fa8a79c) Thanks [@claudiiafg](https://github.com/claudiiafg)! - Fix the keyboard flickering open and shut on the Mobile edit contact drawer, which focused its name field as soon as it mounted and so raised the keyboard into a drawer that was still animating. The field now waits for its drawer to settle before taking focus, as the add contact drawer already did, and focus is opt-in so no other drawer can raise the keyboard by accident.

  Also give the add contact, edit contact and Send add new contact drawers the same keyboard clearance as the add address and edit address drawers, so every contact drawer leaves the same gap above the keyboard on iOS instead of sitting flush against it.

- [#21220](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/pull/21220) [`bb44e2c`](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/commit/bb44e2c4f8ce29b88394b15a17f7c698cb647e74) Thanks [@OlivierFreyssinet](https://github.com/OlivierFreyssinet)! - Move the Contacts device intent renderers into the apps.

  `@features/platform-contacts/device/intents` now exports component-less
  `IntentDefinition`s. Each app owns its renderers under
  `src/mvvm/features/Contacts/deviceIntents/`, composes them into
  `IntentPlatformDefinition`s and injects them into `useContactsIntentsOrchestrator`,
  which no longer imports a production intent implementation.

  A `features/` package cannot resolve translations today, so a renderer that shows
  translated copy has to live in the app.

- [#21128](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/pull/21128) [`31223eb`](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/commit/31223ebdd9335ef14a3ae8712658d17de60924e5) Thanks [@OlivierFreyssinet](https://github.com/OlivierFreyssinet)! - Orchestrate Contacts device confirmations through the Device Intent Executor.

- [#21236](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/pull/21236) [`c62986b`](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/commit/c62986b76467651009a571d64908405988b13571) Thanks [@OlivierFreyssinet](https://github.com/OlivierFreyssinet)! - Register an external address on the device from Contacts. The device intent now calls `@ledgerhq/device-contacts-kit`'s `ContactsManager.registerExternalAddress()`, each failure gets its own JobState (app version too low, invalid input, device rejected, existing-group verification failed, unsupported operation, device error), and both apps render the confirmation step and one `InfoState` per failure. A rejection keeps the job open so the user can retry on the same device.

- [#21185](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/pull/21185) [`cef29a0`](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/commit/cef29a0cd39ee1a7cfb6428ae650595b4479e4d6) Thanks [@OlivierFreyssinet](https://github.com/OlivierFreyssinet)! - Add shared Contacts kit wiring: version-requirement wrappers over `@ledgerhq/device-contacts-kit`, composed with each app's app-global floor into the Contacts device intents' minimum app-version floor.

- [#21320](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/pull/21320) [`0639bea`](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/commit/0639bea01c594c335fb9b0604ad9ffc331936d54) Thanks [@deepyjr](https://github.com/deepyjr)! - Extract the reusable Contact deletion journey into its own flow package and move shared Contacts confirmation presentation to Platform Contacts.

- [#21112](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/pull/21112) [`cdbc3ac`](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/commit/cdbc3acac0045ab860206e32062cc5c417d75196) Thanks [@deepyjr](https://github.com/deepyjr)! - Extract the shared Contacts Edit address journey into an independent flow package.

- [#21287](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/pull/21287) [`34fc080`](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/commit/34fc080bb0c4ec01528404dde38f7c25559ecebe) Thanks [@mcayuelas-ledger](https://github.com/mcayuelas-ledger)! - Order Pay contacts by last sent-to, then last added, derived at read time from account OUT operations

- [#21245](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/pull/21245) [`45ea28b`](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/commit/45ea28b19d1e950bf4e705388a06181a9a7543aa) Thanks [@OlivierFreyssinet](https://github.com/OlivierFreyssinet)! - Provide the EVM address book to the DMK Ethereum signer, so registered contacts can be clear-signed.

  `toEvmAddressBook` maps the Contacts state to an `EvmAddressBook` snapshot, keeping EVM-family addresses only. Each app registers it on `evmAddressBookProvider` at its composition root, and `DmkSignerEth` reads it once per instance, so the recipient and the signing account are matched against the same snapshot. Records whose proof material does not decode are dropped, and signing is left untouched when no contact is usable.

  Ledger account contacts are not provided yet: the snapshot always carries an empty `ledgerAccounts`.

- [#21334](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/pull/21334) [`f0f9990`](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/commit/f0f999034f698b4e0e35928d5cf43a365ed3fef0) Thanks [@mcayuelas-ledger](https://github.com/mcayuelas-ledger)! - Match incoming and outgoing wallet operations to contacts.

  An `index.*` under `shared/`, `domain/` or `features/` may now contain only `export * from "./x"`
  lines, plus an optional default re-export. Having to sort in the export
  (`export { a, b } from "./x"`) proved the target file mixed public and private code; an `index.*`
  holding actual code proved it more loudly. A new nx plugin infers a `lint:structure` target on each
  of the 49 packages and fails on both, along with two related rules: a barrel may not re-export a
  private `internals` location, and it may not re-export another workspace package.

  That last rule removes the proxies. A package that re-exported a neighbour gave the same symbol two
  import paths and hid who actually provided it. Consumers now import the original provider and
  declare the dependency, which is why the two apps gain `@features/flow-contacts-add-contact` and the
  desktop app gains `@features/platform-contacts`.

  Renamed or relocated, with the import specifier unchanged for consumers in every case except where
  noted:

  - `@domain/entity-account-name` no longer exports the `setAccountNames` alias; use
    `bulkSetAccountNames`, the name the slice actually defines.
  - `@shared/cloud-sync` exports `getCloudSyncApi` as a named export from its api module instead of
    re-exporting a default under a different name.

  Five packages are left untouched behind temporary exclusions, each recording how to remove it:

  - `@shared/env`, the facade over the legacy `@ledgerhq/live-env`, which carries the wrapping in its
    barrel.
  - the `@ledgerhq/engagement` and `@ledgerhq/ptx` packages (`flow-analytics-consent`,
    `flow-large-screen-upsell`, `flow-lazy-onboarding-banner`, `flow-pay-card-auth`), so each owning
    team lands the change on its own schedule. Conformant barrels were prepared and verified for them
    before being reverted, so the work is deferred rather than open.

- [#20523](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/pull/20523) [`6f6afe2`](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/commit/6f6afe2b6203b5c46cbe450b254be493689c0cad) Thanks [@deepyjr](https://github.com/deepyjr)! - Extract the Add contact journey into dedicated Contacts platform and flow packages while preserving the Contacts flow facade.

- [#20653](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/pull/20653) [`02c6f9e`](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/commit/02c6f9e46152894aa97648f50a52efaad38aa86c) Thanks [@deepyjr](https://github.com/deepyjr)! - Add formatting checks to Contacts packages.

- [#20595](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/pull/20595) [`43bf6d8`](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/commit/43bf6d8f6600f70b7c2a85615660e7e150e798bf) Thanks [@ysitbon](https://github.com/ysitbon)! - Make every new-architecture barrel a pure regrouping point, and enforce it.

  An `index.*` under `shared/`, `domain/` or `features/` may now contain only `export * from "./x"`
  lines, plus an optional default re-export. Having to sort in the export
  (`export { a, b } from "./x"`) proved the target file mixed public and private code; an `index.*`
  holding actual code proved it more loudly. A new nx plugin infers a `lint:structure` target on each
  of the 49 packages and fails on both, along with two related rules: a barrel may not re-export a
  private `internals` location, and it may not re-export another workspace package.

  That last rule removes the proxies. A package that re-exported a neighbour gave the same symbol two
  import paths and hid who actually provided it. Consumers now import the original provider and
  declare the dependency, which is why the two apps gain `@features/flow-contacts-add-contact` and the
  desktop app gains `@features/platform-contacts`.

  Renamed or relocated, with the import specifier unchanged for consumers in every case except where
  noted:

  - `@domain/entity-account-name` no longer exports the `setAccountNames` alias; use
    `bulkSetAccountNames`, the name the slice actually defines.
  - `@shared/cloud-sync` exports `getCloudSyncApi` as a named export from its api module instead of
    re-exporting a default under a different name.

  Five packages are left untouched behind temporary exclusions, each recording how to remove it:

  - `@shared/env`, the facade over the legacy `@ledgerhq/live-env`, which carries the wrapping in its
    barrel.
  - the `@ledgerhq/engagement` and `@ledgerhq/ptx` packages (`flow-analytics-consent`,
    `flow-large-screen-upsell`, `flow-lazy-onboarding-banner`, `flow-pay-card-auth`), so each owning
    team lands the change on its own schedule. Conformant barrels were prepared and verified for them
    before being reverted, so the work is deferred rather than open.
