# @features/platform-device-action-content

## 0.2.0-next.0

### Minor Changes

- [#21141](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/pull/21141) [`e2f2cfa`](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/commit/e2f2cfa372605742ff6ef29f4e56d9a77fdb86be) Thanks [@OlivierFreyssinet](https://github.com/OlivierFreyssinet)! - Migrate the DeviceActionContent component into a new `@features/platform-device-action-content` package so DDD flows can render it, decoupling it from the `DeviceModelId` enum. Also render Lumen `Tag` labels and `Banner` titles as text in the shared web/native passthrough test stubs.

  The package now exposes `getDeviceActionAnimation`, and both apps resolve their pin/continue device animations through it instead of keeping byte-identical copies of the same 20 Lottie files each. This drops ~2.5 MB of duplicated animation JSON from the desktop and mobile bundles.

  `@features/platform-style` gains `useThemeVariant()`, returning the active `"light" | "dark"` variant from the style provider both apps already mount, plus a `./hooks` entry point so reading it doesn't pull the providers into a consumer's bundle. DeviceActionContent picks its animation through that hook, so neither app injects a theme any more and the component can be used from deeply nested `features/` trees. It reads the styled-components context directly rather than `useTheme`, which throws when no provider is mounted.
