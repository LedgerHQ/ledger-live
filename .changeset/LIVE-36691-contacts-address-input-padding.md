Fix the extra left padding on the address field of the Mobile add address and edit address drawers. Both screens render the address without the "To:" prefix, but Lumen's AddressInput mounts its prefix even when empty, so the prefix still took a slot in the field's inner gap and pushed the address 8px to the right. Add address now drops that gap and keeps the spacing only between the address and the trailing QR code icon, and edit address, which has no trailing icon, uses a plain TextInput instead.
