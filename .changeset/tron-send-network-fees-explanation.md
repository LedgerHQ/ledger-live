Add a TRON send-flow network-fees explanation on the amount screen. The fee row now shows the cost in both fiat and TRX (e.g. `$4.12 • 0.000056 TRX`, or `$0 • 0 TRX` when staked energy and bandwidth cover the transfer), and an info tooltip (desktop) / drawer (mobile) explains whether resources cover the fee or it is paid by burning TRX. Implemented via two family-agnostic send-descriptor accessors (`getNetworkFeesInfo` for the copy, `showFeeCurrencyAmount` for the fee-row display). Other currencies are unchanged.
