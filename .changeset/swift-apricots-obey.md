feat: native dapp support [LIVE-9527]

Migration from [ETH dApp Browser Live App](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/eth-dapp-browser) and [iframe-provider](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/iframe-provider) to support inside LL directly injecting an EIP 6963 compatible provider in the WebView, using params from the manifest.
