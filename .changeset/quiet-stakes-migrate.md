Move Solana staking onto the generic `StakingResources` account attribute.

**Breaking for `@ledgerhq/coin-solana`.** `SolanaResources`, `SolanaResourcesRaw`, `toSolanaResourcesRaw` and `fromSolanaResourcesRaw` are gone. `SolanaAccount` is now an alias of `StakingAccount`, so read staking data from `account.stakingResources` instead of `account.solanaResources`. A stake is a `StakingDelegation` or a `StakingUnbonding` (`SolanaStakingPosition`) rather than a `SolanaStake`: its stake account address is `positionId`, its validator is `validatorAddress`, and the former `activation.active` / `activation.inactive` / `withdrawable` fields are `activeAmount` / `inactiveAmount` / `withdrawableAmount`. `listSolanaStakingPositions`, `solanaActivationState` and `stakeActions` from `@ledgerhq/coin-solana/logic` cover the common access patterns. Accounts already persisted with a `solanaResources` blob are migrated on hydration, so no resync is needed.

`@ledgerhq/types-live` gains `StakingPositionDetails`, mixed into `StakingDelegation` and `StakingUnbonding` for chains that materialize each position as its own on-chain account, plus `actionFeeReserve` on `StakingResources`. Both are optional, so other chains are unaffected.

`@ledgerhq/wallet-cli`'s `earn positions` output changes shape: on `EarnSolanaStake`, `stakeBalance` and `withdrawable` go from `number` to an integer decimal string, so lamport amounts above `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER` stay exact. Anything reading those two fields numerically needs updating.

`@ledgerhq/ledger-wallet-framework` now exports the generic `StakingResources` serializer (`toStakingResourcesRaw`, `fromStakingResourcesRaw`, `assignStakingResourcesToAccountRaw`, `assignStakingResourcesFromAccountRaw`), moved out of the EVM family in `live-common` so every coin module can use it.
