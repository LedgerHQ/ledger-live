Rename a contact on the device from Contacts. The device intent now calls `@ledgerhq/device-contacts-kit`'s `ContactsManager.renameContact()`, which returns the rotated name proof to persist, and both apps render the confirmation step and one `InfoState` per failure. A rejection keeps the job open so the user can retry on the same device.

Rename is a blockchain-agnostic dashboard operation, so it initializes on the dashboard (`BOLOS`) rather than a coin app: a contact with no address is renameable, and an outdated device surfaces as an OS-update screen instead of an app-update one.
