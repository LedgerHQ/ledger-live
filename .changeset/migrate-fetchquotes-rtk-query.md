Migrate the swap `fetchQuotes` helper from axios to an RTK Query endpoint (`swapQuotesApi`). The aggregator `/quote` request now flows through the Redux data layer, and the rawQuotes/providerErrors split is unchanged. Desktop and mobile register the new API and inject their store dispatch at startup via `setSwapQuotesStore`; wallet-cli, which has no app store, sets up a standalone one.

The endpoint itself now lives in the new `@domain/api-swap-quotes` package; live-common re-exports it, so existing call sites are unchanged.

Two behaviour changes to be aware of:

- `/quote` now goes through the authenticated base query, where the legacy axios call sent no credentials. Both apps already register an auth provider on their store's `extra`, so whether a request carries an `Authorization` header is controlled entirely by the `lwdAuth`/`lwmAuth` feature flags. They are disabled by default; enabling either one makes `/quote` send the user's bearer token to the aggregator, and makes a 401/403 trigger the adapter's refresh-and-retry.
- An aggregator HTTP error (4xx/5xx) now resolves to an empty result, so the caller surfaces the `noQuotes` global. Previously the shared axios error interceptor turned these into `LedgerAPI4xx`/`LedgerAPI5xx`, which propagated to the live app as an error. Only transport failures (no HTTP response) still reject, now with a `SwapQuotesRequestFailed` error rather than a bare RTK Query error object.
