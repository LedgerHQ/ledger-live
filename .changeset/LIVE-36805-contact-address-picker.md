Add the web `ContactAddressPicker` dialog to the Pay contact flow and open it from the desktop Pay tab when a contact is pressed. The picker lists the contact's addresses segmented by network with asset-aware icons, resolved through the view model, and exposes an optional add-address action that routes to the contact's add-address flow. Address grouping, icon resolution and truncation are shared from `@features/flow-contacts`. The account/send handoff on address selection lands in a follow-up.
