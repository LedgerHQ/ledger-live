Hide Send and Receive for HyperCore accounts on desktop: HyperCore has no on-chain send on Ledger Wallet and a plain receive is misleading (deposits go through bridging). Both actions are now hidden across the account page, the account context menu and the empty-account state. Also drop the HyperCore per-transaction explorer view: the perps proxy exposes no HyperCore tx hash (deposits settle on Arbitrum, withdrawals expose no link), so the `tx` explorer URL was always broken — only the address explorer view is kept. Finally, the currency is renamed from "Hyperliquid (HyperCore)" to "Hyperliquid".
