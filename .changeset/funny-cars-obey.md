Add a Pay success screen to the Send flow. When the flow is launched from the Pay tab and the transaction succeeds, it now routes to a dedicated `PAY_SUCCESS` step that shows the recipient, amount, source account (with network icon) and a link to the transaction details, instead of the standard confirmation step. Exposes a presentational `PaySuccess` component from `@features/flow-pay-contact` and wires it in ledger-live-desktop via an MVVM `PaySuccessScreen` + `usePaySuccessViewModel`.
