Show the network fee in the currency users care about in the new send flow. When the fee is editable the row follows the amount input's fiat/crypto toggle; when it is not, the row shows the fiat value alongside the native amount, since it is the only place that fee is visible. Fee presets now sub-label both amounts, except coins priced by fee rate (Bitcoin, Kaspa) which keep their sat/vB legend.
