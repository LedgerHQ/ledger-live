Fix Tezos `account.getPublicKey` (Wallet API): resolve the account public key from `xpub` instead of `seedIdentifier`, which is derived from a different path (`44'/1729'/0'`) and returned the same wrong address for every Tezos account. When `xpub` does not contain a valid base58 Tezos public key (edpk/sppk/p2pk), the request is rejected with a dedicated `AccountPublicKeyUnavailable` error and Ledger Live surfaces it natively (error modal on desktop, bottom modal on mobile), prompting the user to re-add the account instead of failing silently. The per-family resolver map is retained for chains that need bespoke retrieval. Also stop seeding `xpub` with the address on Tezos QR import.
