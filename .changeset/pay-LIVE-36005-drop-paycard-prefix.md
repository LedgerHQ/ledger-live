Drop the redundant `PayCard` prefix from the public API of `@features/flow-pay-card-balance`. The package path already scopes the feature, matching sibling flows (`FeatureTour`, `CardLogin`). The hero is now exported as `Balance`, with `useBalanceData`, `aggregateBalance`, `buildBalanceData` and `Balance*` types.
