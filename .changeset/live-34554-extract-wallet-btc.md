Extract the shared UTXO engine (xpub scanning, coin-selection, storage, address crypto) into a standalone `@ledgerhq/wallet-btc` package, dependency-inverted so it no longer imports `@ledgerhq/cryptoassets` or `@ledgerhq/ledger-wallet-framework`: the currency is injected as a typed `WalletBtcCurrency`. Transaction build/sign, RBF fee computation, the device signer, and the `getWalletAccount` resolver stay in `@ledgerhq/coin-bitcoin`. Internal refactor with no behavior change; consumers (`@ledgerhq/live-common`, `ledger-live-desktop`) are rewired to the new import paths.
