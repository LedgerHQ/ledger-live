Add a web `Contacts` section (title + empty state with an Add contact CTA) and mount it on the desktop Pay tab. The package reads the contacts and derives the empty state itself; the host injects the copy and an `onAddContact` handler. The add-contact flow and the Ledger Sync gate land in a follow-up.
