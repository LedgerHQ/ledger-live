Name the Ironwood shielded operations and stop listing Zcash self-transfers.

The Ironwood operation types were declared and given icons but never labelled, so a received or sent Ironwood transaction rendered its raw key in the history. They now carry the same labels, address cells and "Private (Ironwood)" transaction-type detail as the Sapling and Orchard ones.

A shielded transaction that moved no value across the wallet boundary — every note landing on the account's own internal address — was also emitted as a history row of its own: no counterparty, a value of 0, and, when it was the shielded leg of a transparent-funded sweep, a duplicate of the transparent operation already listing that transaction. Such a transaction now produces an operation typed `NONE`, which keeps it in the account data while leaving it out of the lists. Its classification is unchanged, so the fee and balance logic that reads it is unaffected.
