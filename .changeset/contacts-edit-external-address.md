Edit an external address on the device from Contacts. The device intent now calls `@ledgerhq/device-contacts-kit`'s `ContactsManager.editExternalAddressIdentifier()` and `ContactsManager.editExternalAddressScope()`, each returning the rotated address proof to persist while the group's name proof passes through untouched, and both apps render the confirmation step and one `InfoState` per failure.

The device serves address and label edits as two separate commands, so an edit changing both asks the user to confirm twice, showing the same waiting screen for each step rather than numbering them. Nothing partial is ever stored: an abandoned or rejected edit leaves the record untouched, and a retry restarts the whole chain.
