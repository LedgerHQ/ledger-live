# @domain/api-push-devices

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- [#20341](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/pull/20341) [`c016a95`](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/commit/c016a95538dfef2d7ddf1a17914d8cb3e55b644e) Thanks [@ysitbon](https://github.com/ysitbon)! - Split backend access from use case in the RTK Query layer

  `@shared/api-services` now holds one endpoint-less `createApi` per backend (CAL, CoinMarketCap,
  Countervalues, Push Devices), owning its base query, `extraArgument` contract and reducer path.
  `domain/api/*` packages add their endpoints with `injectEndpoints` and their own cache tags with
  `enhanceEndpoints`, so one reducer, middleware and cache now serve every use case on a backend — the two
  CoinMarketCap packages previously had one each. Apps register the service apis.

  `extraArgument` builder names are unchanged, so only import paths move. Reducer paths are renamed after
  their backend (`calApi`, `coinMarketCapApi`, `countervaluesApi`); no persisted data and no endpoint
  behaviour is affected.
