<summary>Step by step guide</summary>
1. **Access Figma Core File:**

   - Navigate to the [Figma Core Library](https://www.figma.com/file/4ZD0Q8lAdv9Bcd7iiW6Cnk/%E2%AD%90-Icons?type=design&node-id=12-3578&mode=design&t=jwTufKP8kEAvyy4H-0).

2. **Export Medium-sized Icons as SVG:**

   - In Figma, open the medium-sized icons.
   - Select all the icons you want to export.
   - Right-click and choose **Export**.
   - Ensure that the export parameters are already set as needed (no modifications required).
   - Export the selected icons as SVG files.

3. **Drop Exported SVGs to icons Package:**

   - Move all the exported SVG files to the `libs/ui/packages/icons/src/svg` directory in your project.

4. **Build @ledgerHQ/icons-ui Package:**

   - Run the command to build the `@ledgerHQ/icons-ui` package:
     ```
      cd libs/ui/packages/icons && pnpm build
     ```
   - Alternatively, you can build app dependencies using:
     ```
      pnpm build:llm:deps
     ```
   - This step ensures that the updated icons are built into the `@ledgerHQ/icons-ui` package.

5. **Verify Changes Locally:**
   - Start your local Storybook to ensure the new icons are rendering correctly:
     ```
      cd libs/ui/packages/react && pnpm storybook
     ```
   - Open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:6006](http://localhost:6006).
   - Check that the new icons are visible and functional in the Storybook UI.
