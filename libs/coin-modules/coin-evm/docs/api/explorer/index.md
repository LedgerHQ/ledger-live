## Methods

#### getExplorerApi

This method is used to determine the explorer designated for a particular currency. While some explorers may share the same API, mainly owing to compatibility with the [Etherscan API](https://docs.etherscan.io/api-endpoints/accounts), any explorer with the capability to provide the complete transaction history of an account can be included as an option.
