- [#21849](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/pull/21849) [`82946e5`](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/commit/82946e53e676943851a8a9e153bafc641a40778b) Thanks [@pawell24](https://github.com/pawell24)! - Prepare NEAR for the generic coin-framework bridge (LIVE-36413).

  - `live-common`: new LiveConfig key `config_near_generic_bridge` (default `false`) gates the NEAR generic route, so it ships dormant and can be enabled or rolled back remotely. `families/near/accountRawAssign.ts` carries both `stakingPositions` and the legacy `nearResources` blob through serialization, in each direction, so an account persisted before the migration keeps the data the UI falls back to. `families/near/bridgeExtensions.ts` exposes the estimation recipient. `families/near/bridge/api.ts` declares `describeOptimisticOperation`, typing a pending withdrawal `WITHDRAW_UNSTAKED` to match what the indexer produces rather than the generic `WITHDRAW_UNBONDED`, which `getMaxAmount` would not have netted out.
  - `coin-near`: `Transaction.fees` widened to `BigNumber | null` and `nonce` added, both round-tripping through `transaction.ts`. Fees serialize with `toFixed`, so a yocto-denominated fee no longer persists in exponential notation, and a missing nonce revives as zero instead of sending `signOperation` into the unimplemented `getNextSequence`. `preload-data.ts` seeds the gas price and the `min_gas_purchase_price` floor with their mainnet values, so `canStake` prices staking at what the chain charges — rather than at zero, or at a tenth of it — on a route that never runs `preload()`.

### Minor Changes

- [#22438](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/pull/22438) [`f9b43be`](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/commit/f9b43beb27558199ac97c56a7787e49c49c8b204) Thanks [@pawell24](https://github.com/pawell24)! - fix(near): size staking gas from measured usage and price it the way the chain does

  Staking fees priced the attached gas at the current gas price. nearcore buys the gas attached
  to a receipt at `max(current_gas_price, min_gas_purchase_price)`, and that floor is an order of
  magnitude above the current price on mainnet, so every stake, unstake and withdraw quoted about a
  tenth of what the account had to hold. A withdraw quoted at 0.02 NEAR was rejected on broadcast
  with `NotEnoughBalance` naming a cost of 0.1759 NEAR.

  The fee now uses the same floor the runtime does, and the attached gas drops from 125 TGas (175
  for withdraw_all) to 50 TGas for every staking call. The heaviest poolv1 path, the first call in
  a new epoch which also restakes and runs the pool's 20 TGas `on_stake_action` callback, was
  measured across five mainnet pools: at most 13.64 TGas charged, and 30 TGas attached succeeds on
  it. The old budget, bought at the floor, locked 0.2 NEAR for a call that burns about 0.001;
  the new one locks 0.055.

  Unstake and withdraw are validated against the balance left above storage staking, which is what
  the chain checks, instead of the spendable balance that also subtracts the minimum-balance
  reserve. The withdraw flow gains the NotEnoughFundsToUnstake banner the unstake flow already
  shows, so a real shortfall is explained with the available balance and Buy/Swap/Deposit actions.

  The NEAR coin-tester scenario's withdraw step now requires the withdrawn amount itself to have
  landed before the send-max step sizes its amount: the pool pays out through a Transfer receipt
  that lands a block after the call, and the smaller gas refund alone used to satisfy the step.

### Minor Changes

- [#21168](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/pull/21168) [`3867cda`](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/commit/3867cda913620a89e0a0e28c3ab670c2b5b48908) Thanks [@cted-ledger](https://github.com/cted-ledger)! - Adopt the coin-module authoring type, dropping the hand-written "not supported" stubs.

  `createApi` now returns its object with `satisfies CoinModuleImpl<NearConfig>` — which keeps the precise shape, so a caller sees exactly which methods exist — and omits the six capabilities NEAR has none of, `getBlock`, `getRewards`, `getNextSequence`, `craftRawTransaction`, `call` and `register`, instead of giving each a `throw new Error("… is not supported")`.

  Why each is absent is recorded above the factory rather than lost with the stub it used to sit on. Two of them are genuine chain facts worth keeping: NEAR's nonce belongs to an access key rather than to an account, so there is no account-level sequence to return, and a staking pool compounds rewards into the staked balance instead of emitting distribution events, so `getStakes` already reports what `getRewards` would have listed. The staking reads NEAR does implement — `getStakes` and `getValidators`, backed by real pool-contract delegation — are untouched.

  The parameters an implementation declares now matter: `satisfies` infers the signature from the function itself, so the trailing `options` argument of `craftTransaction`, `estimateFees` and `validateIntent` carries an explicit `?` rather than relying on the contract to make it optional.

  Consumers see no change. They reach the module through a resolver that applies the framework's `withDefaults`, which supplies every omitted capability, so the same call still raises the same `"<method> is not supported"` error — and `supports(method)` now reports which capabilities are real.

  The api test asserts the whole capability surface with the framework's `capabilityReport()` rather than one test per unimplemented capability: one expectation covers that each is absent, that reaching it raises `"<name> is not supported"`, and that `supports()` agrees. Being an exact comparison it is exhaustive, so implementing or dropping a capability changes the list instead of leaving a test that passes while covering less.

  The package itself stays in the repo so it keeps being published for external consumers, and is bridged to the external coin packages that still peer-depend on it via `pnpm.packageExtensions` using `workspace:*` (which reuses the single in-repo copy, so the dependency graph keeps exactly the physical copies it had before). [LedgerHQ/coin-modules#752](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/coin-modules/pull/752) removes that peerDependency upstream; once it is released the bridge can be dropped, but the package still needs publishing.
