# @ledgerhq/coin-zcash

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- [#20221](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/pull/20221) [`1689e58`](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/commit/1689e583c054bb8ad373bfe9f325b136fe0283bc) Thanks [@cted-ledger](https://github.com/cted-ledger)! - Serve Zcash accounts with a standalone `@ledgerhq/coin-zcash` coin-module (LIVE-34556).

  The module owns all four transfer flows — t→t, t→z, z→t, z→z — and crafts, signs and broadcasts each one as a PCZT through the native `@ledgerhq/zcash-utils` engine, with no legacy PSBT path: it owns the transparent UTXO path itself via `@ledgerhq/wallet-btc` instead of delegating to the Bitcoin bridge. Shielded balances, notes and operations come from the sync engine, so a shielded account reports the balance and history the chain-adapter could only report for its transparent side.

  Which module serves a Zcash account is decided by the existing `zcashShielded` feature flag, mirrored into `live-common` (`src/bridge/zcashRouting.ts`) because a coin-module cannot read React feature flags. OFF (the default) keeps `@ledgerhq/coin-bitcoin`'s Zcash chain-adapter and its legacy transparent path, so nothing changes for users until the flag is turned on; the two implementations are kept accounting-equivalent by differential tests that run both bridges over the same fixtures.

  Desktop hosts the engine in a dedicated utility process, reached over a `zcash:`-prefixed IPC contract owned by the module.

  Two flows do not complete on a NU6.3 chain, where newly shielded value goes to the Ironwood pool: z→z has no builder, since it would need Orchard spends alongside an Ironwood output; and a flow that does build a V6 PCZT cannot be finalized until `@ledgerhq/zcash-utils` exposes a V6 finalizer.
