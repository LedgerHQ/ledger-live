Ledger Live Common (`@ledgerhq/live-common`) is a JavaScript library available via a [NPM package](https://npmjs.com/@ledgerhq/live-common).

This library depends on a bunch of [ledgerjs packages](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/tree/develop/libs/ledgerjs) and put together the core business logic behind [Ledger Live Desktop](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/tree/develop/apps/ledger-live-desktop) and [Ledger Live Mobile](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/tree/develop/apps/ledger-live-mobile).

The stack is pretty standard for a ES6 and FlowType library. The notable dependencies are libraries like **RxJS** and **BigNumber.js**. There is also a bit of React and Redux but exposed in agnostic ways (meaning it's not mandatory to use ‚Äì there will be dedicated entry point for them to offer utilities like React Hooks).
