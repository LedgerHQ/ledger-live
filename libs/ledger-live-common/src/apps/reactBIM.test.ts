/**
 * The tests below only cover the gatekeeping of the BIM feature meaning we only check whether
 * we access it or not depending on our setup. BIM will only be accessible initially to LLM users
 * on a specific transport we named "ble-bim". The feature is also behind a feature flag that allows
 * us to disable it, falling back to the implementation from react.ts in this same folder.
 *
 * There is no new logic introduced here in terms of state handling of the operations, we are just
 * running the communication part on the native side. There are separate implementations for iOS and
 * Android in their corresponding languages.
