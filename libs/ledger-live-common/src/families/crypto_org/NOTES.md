# Cronos POS Chain (formerly Crypto.org)

This directory holds the Cronos POS Chain (formerly Crypto.org) implementation (same thing on LLD and LLM)
For backward compatibility reasons, the id of the chain (`crypto_org`) has been kept as is.

More info on the rebranding can be found here https://blog.cronos-pos.org/p/cryptoorg-chain-becomes-cronos-pos

## Notes üìù

It looks like the Cronos POS Chain is a Cosmos chain. It could be worthwhile at some point to migrate its implementation using the new Cosmos integration framework and remove this specific directory altogether.
