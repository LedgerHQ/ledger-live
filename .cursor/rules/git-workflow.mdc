# Git Workflow & Commit Conventions

> ALWAYS follow the `[.cursor/commands/commit.md]` process when committing.

## Branch Naming

Branches must use a clear prefix based on their purpose:

- **feat/** — New features
- **bugfix/** — Bug fixes
- **support/** — Refactor, tests, CI, improvements
- **chore** — Maintenance, tooling, configs

### Examples

- `feat/add-ethereum-staking`
- `bugfix/fix-transaction-signing`
- `support/update-dependencies`

### Best Practices

- Use **kebab-case**
- Keep names **short, explicit, action-oriented**
- One branch = **one isolated concern**

---

## Workflow Best Practices

- Commits must be **small, isolated, meaningful**
- One commit = **one logical change**
- Prefer **multiple focused commits** over large mixed ones
- Never mix refactor + fix + feature
- Rebase before PR to keep history clean
- Squash only for trivial branches (`support/cleanup`)
