# Cursor Rule Authoring

Reference: https://cursor.com/docs/context/rules#rule-file-format

## Rule Activation Modes

Rules activate based on the combination of `description`, `globs`, and `alwaysApply` in their frontmatter:

| Rule Type               | Frontmatter                                 | Behavior                           |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Always Apply            | `alwaysApply: true`                         | Injected into every conversation   |
| Apply Intelligently     | `description` + `alwaysApply: false`        | Agent decides based on description |
| Apply to Specific Files | `globs` + `alwaysApply: false`              | Auto-activates on matching files   |
| Apply Manually          | `alwaysApply: false` (no description/globs) | Only when @-mentioned in chat      |

A `description` can be combined with `globs` — the description serves as documentation for human readers and also enables agent-decided activation when no matching file is open. The `description` field is always recommended.

## Rules

- **Avoid `alwaysApply: true`** — it clogs the context window by injecting the rule into every conversation unconditionally.
- **Always add a `description`** — it documents the rule's purpose for human readers and enables intelligent agent-decided activation.
- **Prefer smart activation (`description`) over `globs`** — the agent can judge relevance from conversation context better than broad file patterns. Add `globs` only when activation must be strictly tied to specific file types (e.g., test files, `.tsx` components).
- **Never combine `alwaysApply: true` with `description` or `globs`** — it makes the other fields useless since the rule is always injected regardless.
- If using `globs`, ensure patterns are precise (avoid overly broad patterns like `**/*`).
- Keep rules under 500 lines. Split large rules into composable pieces.
- Reference files with `@path` instead of copying their contents.
